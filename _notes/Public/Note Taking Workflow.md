I have tried a multitude of tools to help me nurture ideas and solve problems. Both at work, or in personal endeavours.

To start evolving an idea, or solve a problem, I need a pen. The physical act of writing puts me in a creative mindset and provides a clarity of thought I can't seem to achieve with a keyboard. At this point, it's a stream of consciousness, hastily scribbled and barely discernible. This is where I hone an idea to the point it is ready to be cemented in digital form.

The issue with this approach is that my handwritten notes are often lost (or forgotten). To solve this I use a digital notebook - the Kindle Scribe. I had tried writing notes on a tablet before, but found pen on glass could not replace pen on paper. The e-ink display of the Kindle, however, is eerily paper-like. I will be honest, I would still prefer paper, but the Kindle is good enough to compromise. I may even save a few trees along the way. As well as the paper-feel, the Kindle makes it easy to organise notes and share them as a PDF (or even have it convert them to digital text).
